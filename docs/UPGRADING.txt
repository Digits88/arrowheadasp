ArrowHead ASP Server - Upgrading Guide
======================================

Upgrading from version 0.2.0 or earlier to 0.2.1 or later
---------------------------------------------------------

There was an important change to the WEB.xml file between version 0.2.0 and
0.2.1. ArrowHead now requires a servlet container which supports Servlet
SDK 2.3, and web.xml needs to be modified to reflect this.

First, change the lines at the beginning which look like:

 <!DOCTYPE web-app
    PUBLIC "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.2//EN"
    "http://java.sun.com/j2ee/dtds/web-app_2_2.dtd">

To:

 <!DOCTYPE web-app
    PUBLIC "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN"
    "http://java.sun.com/j2ee/dtds/web-app_2.3.dtd">

(Watch that filename change to the dtd)

And add the lines:

        <listener>
            <listener-class>com.tripi.asp.AspSessionHandler</listener-class>
        </listener>

Right after the <web-app> tag.

NOTE: If you need to run Tomcat under a Servet SDK 2.2 container, the old
web.xml file will still work, but the callback functions Session_OnStart
and Session_OnEnd in global.asa will not be called.
