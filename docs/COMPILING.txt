ArrowHead ASP Server -- Compilation Guide
=========================================

About This Document
-------------------
This document contains information needed to compile ArrowHead. The
instructions are simple and cover mostly obtaining the required libraries.

Requirements
------------
* Everything in the "Requirements" section of INSTALL.txt

Copy the corresponding jar files into arrowhead/lib.

* ANT

Ant is required to build ArrowHead. It is available here:

http://ant.apache.org/

This release it built with ant 1.6.0.

If you can find a package for your distribution, things will be much more 
convienient, as you can just type "ant" to run it.

* JavaCC

Grab JavaCC from:

https://javacc.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList

Copy javacc.jar from javacc-x.x/bin/lib to arrowhead/lib.

This release has been tested against version 3.2.

* Servlet API

Grab the servlet API from the Tomcat installation, I.E.:

/usr/share/tomcat/common/lib/servlet-api.jar

If you are using another servlet server, the servlet api jar file should
be found somewhere with that server. If not, download Tomcat and copy it from
there. It is only needed to build ArrowHead, not to run it.

* JUnit

JUnit can be obtained from:

http://www.junit.org/index.htm

This release is tested with version 3.8.1.

Building ArrowHead
------------------

Once all of the jar files are copied into arrowhead/lib, just type:

$ ant dist

to build the jar files. If any libraries are missing, the build will fail with
a description of what's missing.

The final jar files will be found in dist/lib.

If you wish to build a set of release files (jar, source, documents) type:

$ ant release

And all of the releasable components will be found in dist/release.
